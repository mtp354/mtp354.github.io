excerpt: 'I worked on this project while my two CISNET models were in their infancy and I had not yet begun cost-effectiveness analysis. This project was the perfect opportunity to put my newly developed CEA coding skills into practice in a short time frame.'

The Cancer Genome Atlas identified four subtypes of endometrial cancer, and patients with DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) ultramutated tumors have an improved prognosis. The high intermediate-risk subtype of endometrial cancer is a heterogenous group, and the patients with POLE in this group may benefit from surveillance instead of vaginal brachytherapy. This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of POLE testing in patients with stage I high intermediate-risk endometrial cancer.
