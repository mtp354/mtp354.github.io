This talk covers a new methodology we developed to assist model decision making through visualization and information-theoretic metrics. Many microsimulation models take into account multiple time based variables and choosing which approach best fits the underlying data was largely a process of guesswork. We aimed to put this procedure on more rigorous footing to better inform other CISNET groups.
