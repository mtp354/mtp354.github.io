This project was inspired by recent graphical transformer machine learning based methods for causal discovery. The challenge for causal discovery benchmarking is the need for a known underlying causal structure to compare with. My colleague Dr. Jiheum Park found an excellent dataset on Alzheimer's progresson which has a known gold standard causal structure. This was a great way to test a novel AI based methodology.
