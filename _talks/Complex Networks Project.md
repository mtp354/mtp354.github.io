This project involved deploying complex network analyis metrics to a live dataset of global conflict events to explore the dynamics of formation and counterformation in conflict zones. I partitioned the data into friends/enemy networks based on allegiances at particular conflict events and explored scaling, betweeness, clustering and distance metrics to better understand how conflict propagates.
